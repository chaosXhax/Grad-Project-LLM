With the increasing complexity of network infrastructure and modern cybersecurity threats emerging, organizations are facing increasingly difficult challenges in optimizing and securing device configurations and responding to large amounts of alerts effectively. Cybersecurity threats have become more common and large scale, making it increasingly difficult for information security teams to stay afloat during peak activity hours. Traditional automation is becoming a more manual task with the increased complexity and attack surfaces in modern organizations, and a need has emerged for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to be used to supplement manual configuration baselining and log analysis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a useful tool to automate and supplement baseline analysis of network/appliance configuration and to enhance incident response by identifying anomaly trend data automatically without manual intervention. These models have either been pre-trained for this specific purpose or can use data sources from the public internet to recommend optimizations and recognize common alert patterns. Using natural language processing and machine learning, LLMs are capable of identifying misconfigurations, making recommendations, and providing real-time insight into logs, security alerts, and their patterns. This paper explores the application of LLMs in network configuration and security, focusing on their role in analyzing device configurations, improving response mechanisms to security threats, and testing how accurate LLMs can be to take over the heaving lifting with baseline configuration and alert review.
